# Swarth
**Swarth** modifies web pages to use a dark color scheme or based on the user's preferences. This extension is a fork of [Dark Background and Light Text](https://github.com/m-khvoinitsky/dark-background-light-text-extension/), rewritten to utilize XUL overlays instead of Jetpack/Add-ons SDK. Furthermore, several additional features were included, such as following the browser's preferred color scheme and keeping changes made in private browsing sessions.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

## Download
